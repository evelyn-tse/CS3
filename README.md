## Camouflaged Image Classification
This repository contains the study, deliverable, data, and reference materials necessary to complete the case study on camouflaged image classification. 

## Hook and Rubric
The hook document outlines the case study and scenario and is seen in the file called "CS3 Hook.pdf" file. The rubric for this assignment outlines the submission requirements, formatting, and necessary deliverables for the assignment. This can be found in the "CS3 Rubric.docx.pdf" file. Both documents should be continuously refrenced to make sure requirements and understanding of the case study are successfully met. 

## Data
The necessary data is located in the "DATA" folder. This folder includes the original CAMO_COCO data set used and the cleaned data set, which is a subset of the original dataset. 

## Reference Materials
The "Reference Materials" folder contains resources used to provide understanding of necessary concepts for this case study. It includes resources on context and technical aspects of the case study. Context on MobileNetSSD will be provided as a starting point to get you familiar with a popular object detection model. A reference material on other types of object detection machine learning models is also included if another model is preferred. 

## Scripts
The necessary files to explore MobileNetSSD object detection is included in the "SCRIPTS" folder. NOTE: MobileNetSSD is not required to complete this analysis. Other object detection models may be used to suit your needs instead.
